            <h1>About Me</h1> 
            <p>
                My name is Omar Mohamed Ahmed im 18 years old and september 7 <sup>th</sup> I graduated from <abbr title="Brookefield High School">BHS</abbr>  last year and took a semester off since I really needed a break from school. <br>  I also didn't know what major I wanted to pursue in college because I'm a really indecisive person, and I didn't want to hurry into anything if I wasn't sure I would like it completely. until I heard this amazing quote 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
        "More is lost by indecision than wrong decision. Indecision is the theif of opportunity. it will steal you blind." -<cite>Marcus Tullius Cicero </cite>
            </blockquote>
    <p>
        After reading that quote, I realised that I could never be absolutely certain of anything; the only way to know for sure is to go out and experience it. <br> I also realised that life is all about trying new things, so I just decided to apply for this programme, knowing that if I liked it, it would be fine; if not, it would still be fine and I would still have options. anyway, this programme is cool so far.
