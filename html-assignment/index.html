        I graduated from<abbr title="Brookefield High School">BHS</abbr>  last year and took a semester off since I really needed a break from school. <br>  I also didn't know what major I wanted to pursue in college because I'm a really indecisive person, and I didn't want to hurry into anything if I wasn't sure I would like it completely. until I heard this amazing quote 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "More is lost by indecision than wrong decision. Indecision is the theif of opportunity. it will steal you blind." -<cite>Marcus Tullius Cicero </cite>
